## Loading and preprocessing the data
```{r readingData, echo = TRUE}
# the csv file needs to be in the working directory
actvt<- read.csv("activity.csv", header=TRUE, sep=",")
# get the number of days in the dataset - there are 61 days
length(unique(actvt$date))
# get each day's observations
table(actvt$date, useNA="ifany") 
# check the classes of variables.
sapply(actvt[1,], class)
# change the "steps" variable class to Numeric
actvt$steps <- as.numeric(actvt$steps) 
# change the "interval" variable class to Numeric
actvt$interval <- as.numeric(actvt$interval) 
# new data frame after removing NAs.
actvtData<- actvt[complete.cases(actvt),] 
```



## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?

# obtaining the total number of steps for each day:
sm<- ddply(actvtData, c("date"), function (x) apply(x[1], 2, sum)) 
hist(sm$steps, xlab= "Total Number of Steps/Day",
      main="Histogram of the Total Number of Steps Taken Each Day",
      col= "red")
# obtaining the total number of steps for each day:
sm<- ddply(actvtData, c("date"), function (x) apply(x[1], 2, sum)) 
hist(sm$steps, xlab= "Total Number of Steps/Day",
      main="Histogram of the Total Number of Steps Taken Each Day",
      col= "red")
# obtaining the mean of total steps:
mean(sm$steps, na.rm=TRUE) # 10766.19
# obtaining the median of total steps:
median(sm$steps, na.rm=TRUE) # 10765

## What is the average daily activity pattern?



## Imputing missing values



## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
