## Loading and preprocessing the data
```{r readingData, echo = TRUE}
# the csv file needs to be in the working directory
act<- read.csv("./Repro/activity.csv", header=TRUE, sep=",")
dim(act)
names(act)
length(unique(act$date)) # there are 61 days in the dataset.
table(act$date, useNA="ifany") # there are 288 observations related to each day.
sapply(act[1,], class) # Obtaining the class of each variable.

#changing the class of the variable "steps" to be Numeric:
act$steps <- as.numeric(act$steps) 
#changing the class of the variable "interval" to be Numeric:
act$interval <- as.numeric(act$interval) 
actData<- act[complete.cases(act),] # new data frame after removing NAs.
```



## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?



## What is the average daily activity pattern?



## Imputing missing values



## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
